# ALGORITHM EXERCISES

# sameFrequency

Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

The solution MUST have the following complexities:

Time: O(n)

Sample Input:

sameFrequency(182, 281) // true

sameFrequency(34, 14) // false

sameFrequency(3589578, 5879385) // true

sameFrequency(22, 222) // false

# characterCounter

Write a function that takes in a string and outputs an object. The object needs to display each unique character (in lowercase format) of the string as keys, and the amount of times that character appears in the string as the value.

Sample Input:

characterCounter("People") // { p: 2, e: 2, o: 1, l: 1 }

characterCounter("Sally sells shells by the seashore") // { s: 7, a: 2, l: 6, y: 2, e: 5, h: 3, b: 1, t: 1, o: 1, r: 1 }
